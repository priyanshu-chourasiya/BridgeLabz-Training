/*
 *  FoodFest – Sorting Stalls by Customer Footfall (Merge Sort)
Story: At a multi-day food festival, organizers track footfall at every stall each day. They collect
daily logs from all zones (already sorted by count), and use Merge Sort to combine zone-wise
data into a master list for performance evaluation.
Concepts Involved:
● Merge Sort
● Combining multiple sorted datasets
● Stability in data with equal values
